# U.S. States Game

The U.S. States Game is an interactive Python application built using the Turtle graphics library. It provides a fun and educational way to learn the names of all 50 states in the United States.

## How to Play

1.Run the Python script and the game will display a blank map of the United States.

2.A prompt will appear asking you to name a state.

3.Enter the name of a state and press Enter.

4.If you guess correctly, the state name will be displayed on the map, and your progress will be tracked.

5.Keep guessing the state names until you correctly identify all 50 states or choose to stop.

6.To exit the game before completing all states, simply enter "No" when prompted.

## Data Source

The game uses data from the "50_states.csv" file, which contains a list of all 50 U.S. states along with their coordinates on the map.
